Glad to see you here. My name is Yuhan Li (李宇涵), currently a second-year master in Computer School of Computer science, Nankai University. My master advisor is [Wei Shen](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/2020/0507/c13620a271227/page.htm). Meanwhile, I am also very lucky to be a research intern in Knowledge Computing Group, Microsoft Reserach Asia, co-advised by [Zhiwei Yu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/zhiwyu/) and [Börje Karlsson](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/borjekar/).

## <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;My research direction

In the past few years, my reserach interest focuses on **Entity Linking**:
* Entity Linking: is the process of linking entity mentions appearing in web text with their corresponding entities in a knowledge base.

I am also familiar with reinforcement learning such as Policy Gradient and Self-play, which have been successfully employed on our reserach projects.

I also have strong interests in knowledge graphs and their related applications, such as knowledge base question answering, knowledge-aware recommendation, and knowledge base construction.

<!-- ## <i class="fa fa-ft fa-hands-helping"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I Enjoy Imparting Knowledge

I am passionate as Teaching Assistants (TA) for several courses, including Computer Organization, Operating System and Software Engineering. I have led the writing of an [guidebook (Chinese)](https://github.com/SivilTaram/BUAAOS-guide-book) for Operating System (in Chinese). 

In 2017, to spread my experience as TA to the younger TAs, I founded the first undergraduate teaching assistant organization **S.T.A.R**. The introduction of S.T.A.R can be found [here (Chinese)](https://www.cnblogs.com/SivilTaram/p/ta_road.html), and the official white paper can be found [here (Chinese)](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/bkspy/bkspy/S_T_A_Rjftdbps_.htm).

In 2021, to promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the **MLNLP community**. I am also honored to be the first rotating chair of the MLNLP community. -->
