Natural Language Interfaces to Databases (NLIDB, a.k.a. NL-To-SQL, Semantic Parsing) allows users to search databases using natural language instead of SQL-like query languages. While saving the users from having to learn query languages, multi-turn interaction with NLIDB usually involves multiple queries where contextual information is vital to understand the users' query intents. In this paper, we address a typical contextual understanding problem, termed as follow-up query analysis. **Our work summarizes typical follow-up query scenarios and provides the new FollowUp dataset with 1000 query triples on 120 tables**(Below).

| Scenario  | Example |
|:---|:---|
| Analytica | Precedent : In 1995, is there any network named CBC?<br> Follow-up : Any TSN?<br>Fused : In 1995, is there any network named TSN? |
| Compare | Precedent : How much money has Smith earned?<br>Follow-up : Compare it with Bill Collins.<br>Fused : Compare money Smith earned with Bill Collins. |
| Calc & Stats | Precedent : List all universities founded before 1855.<br>Follow-up : Show their number.<br>Fused : Show the number of all universities founded before 1855. |
| Extremum |Precedent : Which stadium has the most capacity?<br>Follow-up : Which get the highest attendance?<br>Fused : Which stadium get the highest attendance? |
| Filter |Precedent : How many roles are from studio paramount?<br>Follow-up : List all titles produced by that studio.<br>Fused : List all titles produced by studio paramount. |
| Group | Precedent : Show the industry which has the most companies?<br>Follow-up : Show in different countries.<br>Fused : Show the industry which has the most companies in different countries. |
| Sort | Precedent : Show all chassis produced after the year 1990.<br>Follow-up : Sort them by year.<br>Fused : Show all chassis produced after the year 1990 and sort by year. |
| Search | Precedent : What position did Sid O’Neill play?<br>Follow-up : Which players else are in the same position?<br>Fused : Which players play in the position of Sid O’Neill excluding Sid O’Neill? |
